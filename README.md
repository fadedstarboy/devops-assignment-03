# devops-assignment-03

## Instructions:
- Create a backend service (preferably in Nodejs or Python) that will perform the following things:
- Create REST APIs to perform CRUD operations
- Data can be stored in memory (no need of DB)
- Application should be dockerized
- Suggest architecture on how this application should be deployed on Kubernetes (with best practices)


## Our expectations for this challenge include:
- Source code that we can review and execute with minimal efforts
- Documentation, where relevant. (README file)
- Incorporation of Software Engineering best practices and design patterns, where relevant. (ex. architecture design from a network security perspective)
- If at any point something is unclear or you prefer a different approach, please document (code and README) and explain why.
